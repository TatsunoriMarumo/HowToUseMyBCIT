# **Setting up myBCIT email**

This section provides step-by-step instruction on how to configure your myBCIT email settings. myBCIT email is is primarily used for 

- communication with instructors and school 
- registration on external sites or tools where student services are available.

To prepare your myBCIT email for the program, it's important to configure both email [forwarding](glossary.md\#forwarding) and [signature](glossary.md\#signature). 

## Set Up Forwarding
By default, to check for new emails, you need to visit my BCIT site each time, which is not only time consuming, but also increases the risk of missing important messages. Therefore, setting up forwarding to an email account you use on your device is highly recommended. 

1. Login to **<u>[myBCIT](https://my.bcit.ca){:target="_blank"}</u>**.

2. Click **My Mail**.

When sending emails to instructors or school, you need to include your name, student ID, program, and set name. This can be tedious to enter each time and easy to forget.
